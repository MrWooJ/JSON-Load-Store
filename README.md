# JSON-Load-Store
With this module, you can simply store your config files in one server and share it between differenct channels and services. This module is based on Redis database, Therefore the performance and the speed of CRUD oprations are extremely high. As there was no SaaS like this, I built one for my own usages sake.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Dependencies
lists the packages that the project depends on and allows to specify the versions of a package that the project mat use using semantic versioning rules. makes your build reproducible, and therefore much easier to share with other developers.
```json
    "compression": 			"^1.0.3",
    "cors": 				"^2.5.2",
    "helmet": 				"^1.3.0",
    "loopback": 			"^3.0.0",
    "loopback-boot": 			"^2.6.5",
    "loopback-component-explorer": 	"^4.0.0",
    "loopback-connector-kv-redis": 	"^1.1.0",
    "loopback-connector-redis": 	"^0.1.0",
    "loopback-datasource-juggler": 	"^3.15.4",
    "serve-favicon": 			"^2.0.1",
    "strong-error-handler": 		"^2.0.0"
```

### Installation
Please install the following dependencies before building JSON-Loader. This is the recommended way to install dependencies on your machine.
```sh
$ npm install
```
### Retriving API Key
After buidling the project, You have to have a valid API Key. This key will distingushes the users from eachother wich they wont be able to access to another users' resources.

For now, There's no API Key Generator, You can simply generate any. But make sure to use a common api key in all your requests!
### Running Web Service
Once you have installed the dependencies, You can run the development instance webservice which is listening on port 3000. You can change the port in config.json file later on. 
```sh
$ node .
  Web server listening at: http://localhost:3000
  Browse your REST API at http://localhost:3000/explorer
```

## API References
By browing the `http://localhost:3000/explorer` you can visualy watch the GUI API. Another great way to learn more about the routes and APIs included with module is to read their source. Look under the `common/models` directory for models like basic and controller. From the source and provided diagram you can get an accurate understanding of each route's behavior and API.
